/**
 * MISRA-C:2004 Rule 18.04: (Required) Unions shall not be used.
 * 
 * Rule prohibits the reuse of memory areas for unrelated purposes. However,
 * even when memory is being reused for related purposes, there is still a risk
 * that the data may be misinterpreted. Therefore, this rule prohibits the use
 * of unions for any purpose. It is recognised nonetheless that there are
 * situations in which the careful use of unions is desirable in constructing an
 * efficient implementation. In such situations, deviations to this rule are
 * considered acceptable provided that all relevant implementation-defined
 * behaviour is documented. This might be achieved in practice by referencing
 * the implementation section of the compiler manuals from the design
 * documentation. The kinds of implementation behaviour that might be relevant
 * are:
 * 
 * padding - how much padding is inserted at the end of the union
 * 
 * alignment - how are members of any structures within the union aligned
 * 
 * endianness - is the most significant byte of a word stored at the lowest or
 * highest memory address
 * 
 * bit-order - how are bits numbered within bytes and how are bits allocated to
 * bit fields
 * 
 * The use of deviations is acceptable for (a) packing and unpacking of data,
 * for example when sending and receiving messages, and (b) implementing variant
 * records provided that the variants are differentiated by a common field.
 * Variant records without a differentiator are not considered suitable for use
 * in any situation.
 *

 * [STATUS: DONE]
